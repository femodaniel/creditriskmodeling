## 🧠 Background
Credit risk modelling is the foundation of assessing a borrower’s default probability...

## ⚙️ Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline for estimating PD, LGD, EAD, and EL.

## 🧩 Pipeline
1. Data ingestion  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
5. Evaluation and Explainability (SHAP, ROC, Precision-Recall)
